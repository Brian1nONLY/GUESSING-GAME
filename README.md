# GUESSING-GAME
GUESSING GAME in python

This is a simple guessing game.

You try to guess the number that the computer is thinking from 1 to 100.

And for each guess, the computer will tell you whether you are warmer or colder to the number.

Warmer in this game means closer and colder means you are further away from the number.

Once you have guessed the correct number, the computer will return to you the number of guesses it took you to guess it.

Have fun trying this game!
